# Weather App

This is a weather forecasting application built with React. It fetches weather data from an API and displays a 24-hour forecast.

## Work in Progress

This project is a work in progress. I am actively developing this program.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/` - Contains the source code for the application.
- `api/` - Contains the API calls.
- `components/` - Contains the React components.
- `hooks/` - Contains the custom React hooks.
- `public/` - Contains the static files served by the application.

## Key Files

- `src/api/weatherApi.js` - Contains the API calls for fetching weather data.
- `src/components/24HForecast/TemperatureGraph.js` - Displays the temperature graph for the 24-hour forecast.
- `src/App.js` - The main application component.
- `src/hooks/useWeatherData.js` - A custom hook for fetching and managing weather data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your API keys.

## Running the Application
